1. first idea

2. Okay, so I have a feeling that this is going to need, I need to make a chatbot for this, and I need to have like a specific database for this, and also I think a part of data analytics also kind of plays a role in this. So yeah, so what kind of skills do I need specifically to make this work? Like data analysis should be done, cleaning should be done, no, no need of cleaning, right? I'm not sure, so can you just give me an idea of what kind of things that I need to learn, and like what kind, what, what are the steps that I need to take, and give me a schedule on what all to take, like can you plan this whole asset project planning thing?

3. Yes, but can you make the project timeline, the schedule so that I make the projects as I learn? Because if you build a project path in a way that I can learn as I go all the things, then it would be beneficial for me as well as I'll be able to learn it more, right? Can you make it a learning-based project planning kind of thing? Project-based learning? Yeah, that's the word. After just giving me an outline of the project, can you tell me the levels of the basic websites, the steps, what the website would look like after each session so I could have a visualization of it? Thank you.
